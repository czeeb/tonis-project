Vagrant
=======

Tonis comes with a Vagrantfile.  Utilizing [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com), the working directory will be synced with the virtualized environment.  You will need to have both [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com) and [Docker](https://www.docker.com) installed.  You are responsible for running composer and bower from the host.

```sh
sudo vagrant up --provider=docker
```

SSH is not enabled, but you can still get a shell prompt in the container.

```sh
$ sudo docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                             COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                  NAMES
